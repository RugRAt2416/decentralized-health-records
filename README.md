🏥 Decentralized Health Records System (DHRW)- 

A blockchain-powered medical record management system that enables patients to securely store, control, and share their health records with doctors using smart contracts and Web3 wallets.

🚨 Problem Statement- 

Traditional medical record systems are:

Centralized and vulnerable to data breaches

Fragmented across hospitals and clinics

Lacking patient control over data access

Prone to unauthorized access and manipulation

Patients have no transparency or ownership over who accesses their sensitive medical data.

💡 Solution Overview- 

DHRW is a decentralized health record platform that:

Stores medical record references securely on blockchain

Uses MetaMask / Web3 wallets for authentication

Allows patients to grant or revoke access to doctors

Maintains an immutable audit trail of all access events

Encrypts files and stores them via IPFS-backed backend

Patients stay in control — always.

🧠 Key Features- 

🔐 Wallet-Based Authentication (MetaMask / Web3)

📁 Secure Medical Record Upload

👩‍⚕️ Doctor Access Approval / Rejection

🧾 Immutable Audit Logs (Blockchain Events)

🛡️ Patient-Owned Data Control

🌐 IPFS-backed Encrypted File Storage

🎨 Modern, intuitive UI/UX
