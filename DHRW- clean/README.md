# Decentralized Health Records (DHRW)

A blockchain-based medical record management system that gives patients full control over their health data.

## Problem
Medical records are stored in centralized systems, leading to data breaches, lack of transparency, and poor interoperability.

## Solution
DHRW uses Ethereum smart contracts and IPFS to store medical record references securely while enabling patients to control access permissions.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Blockchain: Ethereum, Solidity, Hardhat
- Web3: Ethers.js, MetaMask
- Storage: IPFS
- Backend: Node.js, Express

## Features
- Secure medical record upload
- Patient-controlled doctor access
- Immutable audit logs
- MetaMask authentication

## How to Run
1. Start backend server
2. Deploy smart contract
3. Open frontend and connect MetaMask
